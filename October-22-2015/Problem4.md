Solve the Towers of Hanoi problem:
> The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower,[1] and sometimes pluralized) is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

> The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

> Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

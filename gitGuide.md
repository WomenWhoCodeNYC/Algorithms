# GitGuide
Want to submit a pull request to this repo but a little unsure how to do it? Don't worry. We've got you covered with our GitGuide!

## Step 1
Fork the repo
![first](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/Algorithms/blob/master/images/first.png?raw=true)

## Step 2
Navigate back to your personal repo and copy the clone link from your fork. Take note that you should be in YOUR fork, so it should say at the top left something like yourusername/Algorithms not WomenWhoCodeNYC/Algorithms
![clone](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/Algorithms/blob/master/images/clone.png?raw=true)

## Step 3
From the command line make a local clone with that copied link.
![clone2](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/Algorithms/blob/master/images/clone2.png?raw=true)

## Step 4
`cd` into the repo, make a new branch (call it anything you'd like), and start writing some code
![branch](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/Algorithms/blob/master/images/branch.png?raw=true)

#### Random Note
`atom .` is a shortcut I use to open my text editor, you might use `subl` to open sublime or some other way of opening the repository.

## Step 5
When you've added your problems and solutions and are ready to share them: add, commit, and push your changes
![commit](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/Algorithms/blob/master/images/commit.png?raw=true)

## Step 6
On github on your repo, click that you want to Compare and Pull Request
![pullRequest](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/Algorithms/blob/master/images/pullRequest.png?raw=true)

From there, ensure that your pull request is to WomenWhoCodeNYC, and add a description and title for your PR. Click create pull request!
![pullRequest2](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/Algorithms/blob/master/images/pullRequest2.png?raw=true)

## Step 7
Wait a few days for some feedback. We may make suggestions on how to improve your code or how to submit things so that they match our current style guides. If so you'll see the feedback on your public pullrequest on the WomenWhoCodeNYC Algorithm's repo. Or we might choose to merge it as is!

## Step 8
Pat yourself on the back, tweet about your amazing accomplishment, tell a friend to submit something, move on to bigger and better open source projects, and be sure to come to our Monthly Algorithms meet ups :)

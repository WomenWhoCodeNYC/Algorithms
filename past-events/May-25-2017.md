# More About C4Q's Access Code

C4Q’s Access Code program teaches coding and professional skills to talented adults from diverse and low-income backgrounds. Our 10-month program prepares individuals for software engineering jobs at companies like Kickstarter, Capital One, and IBM. Graduates have gone from making $18,000 to over $85,000 a year on average.

The upcoming Access Code program will teach Android app development, iOS app development, and Full-Stack Web development. We are selecting 144 students for the this coming year. We will offer both a daytime as well as a nights and weekends schedule. To create a diverse tech community that's representative of NYC, cohorts will be at least 50% women, 50% underrepresented minorities, 50% immigrants, and 60% do not have college degrees.

We aim to remove barriers to learning to code. We provide laptops, a 24/7 space for learning, and other resources needed to succeed. The program has no upfront costs. Instead, all participants commit to paying a percentage of their future earnings back to C4Q upon securing a job in the tech industry.

We highly encourage women, underrepresented minorities, and those without college degrees to apply.  Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. Early application deadline is Monday May 15th, and the final application deadline is Monday June 12.

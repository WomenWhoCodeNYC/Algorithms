## Announcements!

### Volunteer with ScriptEd and teach kids to code!

ScriptEd is an NYC-based nonprofit that engages professional developers on a volunteer basis to teach web development to students who attend under resourced high schools throughout NYC.

Volunteers teach twice a week for the school year (approximately late September through late May). Each volunteer is part of a four-person team, and is supported by one of ScriptEd’s staff members. To learn more, [click here](https://scripted.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Volunteer-1-Pager.pdf).

We strive to build volunteer teams that reflect the cultural diversity of the students, neighborhoods and communities we serve. Volunteers who identify as female and people of color are especially encouraged to apply.  

Fill out a volunteer application at [bit.ly/ScriptEdVolunteerNYC](http://bit.ly/ScriptEdVolunteerNYC) and a ScriptEd staff member will be in touch. Volunteering is a great way to meet like-minded people while helping youth access careers in tech. We’d love for you to join us!

### Win a ticket to AlterConf!

At Olark, our mission is to "Make Business Human." As part of that mission, several of us have participated in AlterConfs across the country and have found it energizing and inspiring! We have 2 tickets the the next [AlterConf](https://alterconf.com/conferences/2017/new-york-city-ny) on Sunday August 20 here in NYC that we’d like to give away to folks who share in that mission. In 250 words, tell us how you make your code 'human' - or how your approach to coding is 'human.' To enter, email Karl@Olark.com

We'll pick two winners for the tickets, and we'll pick three runners up to receive [our brand new Olark t-shirts](https://twitter.com/birdsongsocial/status/894553532023672832).

The deadline to enter is Tonight! Wednesday, August 16. We'll announce the winners by August 17.

We would like to share the winner's entries on the [Olark blog](https://blog.olark.com/) with a link back to your company or organization. If you're okay with that, then continue reading :)

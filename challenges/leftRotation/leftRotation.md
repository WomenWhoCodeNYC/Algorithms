## Problem
A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements  unit to the left. 
For example, if  left rotations are performed on array [1,2,3,4,5] , then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2].

Given an array a of n integers and a number d , perform d left rotations on the array. 
Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.

## Function Description

Complete the function rotLeft in the editor below. It should return the resulting array of integers.

rotLeft has the following parameter(s):

An array of integers a .
An integer d, the number of rotations.

## Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers  n and  d, the size of a and the number of left rotations you must perform. 
The second line contains n space-separated integers a[i].

## Sample Input
```
5 4
1 2 3 4 5
```

## Sample Output
```
5 1 2 3 4
```

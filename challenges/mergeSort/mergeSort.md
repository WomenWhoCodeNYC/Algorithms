# Implement Merge Sort

What is merge sort?
```
Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:

Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, 
each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted).
Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted
sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining.
This will be the sorted list.
```

Can you show an example?

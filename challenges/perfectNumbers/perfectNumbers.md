# Perfect numbers

A [perfect number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number) is a positive integer that is the sum of its proper positive divisors excluding the number itself.

Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself).

## Problem

Write a function which says whether a number is perfect.

## Example

```javascript
f(28)
// => true

f(29)
// => false
```

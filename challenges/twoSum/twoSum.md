### Two Sum

Design a method that takes an array of positive integers and returns the indices of the two distinct integers in the array that sum up to a specific target value.

**Notes**:
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
- Can you think of at least two solutions/algorithms to solve the problem: one that is space efficient and another that is time efficient?

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

**Add on challenge**: Extend your solution so that it returns **all pairs** of indices that solve the problem.

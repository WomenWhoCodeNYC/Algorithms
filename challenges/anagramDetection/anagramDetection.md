## Anagram Detection

Write a function that accepts two parameters, a parent and a child string. The function should return how many times the child string, or an anagram of the child string, appears in the parent string. (There is a solution which can be done in near instant time!)

#### Example:

```javascript
f('AdnBndAndBdaBn', 'dAn')
// 4 ("Adn", "ndA", "dAn", "And")

f('AbrAcadAbRa', 'cAda')
// 2
```

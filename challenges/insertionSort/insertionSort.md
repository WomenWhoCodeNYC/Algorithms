# Implement Insertion Sort

What is Insertion Sort?
```
Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, 
and growing a sorted output list. 
Each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, 
finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. 
It repeats until no input elements remain.

Can you show an example?
```
Example: The following table shows the steps for sorting the sequence {3, 7, 4, 9, 5, 2, 6, 1}. 
In each step, the key under consideration is underlined. 
The key that was moved (or left in place because it was biggest yet considered) 
in the previous step is shown in bold.

3 7 4 9 5 2 6 1

3 7 4 9 5 2 6 1

3 7 4 9 5 2 6 1

3 4 7 9 5 2 6 1

3 4 7 9 5 2 6 1

3 4 5 7 9 2 6 1

2 3 4 5 7 9 6 1

2 3 4 5 6 7 9 1

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9
```

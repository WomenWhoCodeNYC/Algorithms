## Get products of all integers

You have a list of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index.
Write a function get_products_of_all_ints_except_at_index() that takes a list of integers and returns a list of the products.

*For example, given:

  [1, 7, 3, 4]

Your function should return:

  [84, 12, 28, 21]

by calculating:

[7*3*4, 1*3*4, 1*7*4, 1*7*3]*



**Do not use division in your solution.**

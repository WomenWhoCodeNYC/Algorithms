##Coin denominations

Imagine you landed a new job as a cashier...
Your quirky boss found out that you're a programmer and has a weird request about something they've been wondering for a long time.

Write a function that, given:

* an amount of money
* an array of coin denominations

computes the number of ways to make amount of money with coins of the available denominations.

Example: for amount=4 (4¢) and denominations=[1,2,3] (1¢, 2¢ and 3¢), your program would output 4—the number of ways to make 4¢:

*1¢, 1¢, 1¢, 1¢
1¢, 1¢, 2¢
1¢, 3¢
2¢, 2¢*
